# LP-DiD Python Package - Complete Feature Set

## Overview

The LP-DiD Python package now provides a comprehensive implementation of Local Projections Difference-in-Differences with advanced features for causal inference.

## Core Features

### 1. Instrumental Variables (IV) Support

**Implementation**: Leverages pyfixest's native IV capabilities with three-part formula syntax.

```python
# Standard DiD
formula = "~ controls | fixed_effects"

# DiD with IV
formula = "~ controls | fixed_effects | D_treat ~ instrument1 + instrument2"
```

**Features**:
- Automatic 2SLS estimation for each horizon
- First-stage F-statistics for weak instrument detection
- Kleibergen-Paap statistics when available
- First-stage coefficient reporting
- Compatible with all other features (bootstrap, weights, etc.)

**Diagnostics Provided**:
- `iv_diagnostics`: DataFrame with first-stage F-stats and weak IV indicators
- `first_stage`: DataFrame with first-stage regression coefficients
- Automatic weak instrument warnings (F < 10)

### 2. Treatment Effect Heterogeneity

**Implementation**: Interaction terms between treatment and observable characteristics.

```python
# Single interaction
interactions = "~ size"  # Creates D_treat × size

# Multiple interactions
interactions = "~ size + i.industry"  # Size and industry interactions

# With factor variables
interactions = "~ continuous_var + i.categorical_var"
```

**Features**:
- Automatic inclusion of main effects
- Support for continuous and categorical moderators
- Works with IV specifications
- Full inference on interaction terms

**Output**:
- Main treatment effect (baseline)
- Interaction coefficients with SEs and p-values
- Allows computation of marginal effects at different values

### 3. Combined IV + Heterogeneity

```python
lpdid = LPDiD(
    data=df,
    depvar='y',
    unit='unit',
    time='time',
    treat='treat',
    formula="~ controls | FE | D_treat ~ instruments",
    interactions="~ size + i.region",
    wildbootstrap=999
)
```

This estimates heterogeneous Local Average Treatment Effects (LATEs).

### 4. Enhanced Reporting

**No Plotting**: As requested, all plotting functionality has been removed.

**Comprehensive Summary Method**:
```python
results.summary()  # Prints detailed results including:
# - Event study estimates
# - Pooled estimates  
# - IV diagnostics
# - First stage results
# - Weak instrument warnings
# - All interaction effects
```

**Structured Output**:
- `event_study`: Main results with interaction terms
- `pooled`: Pre/post pooled effects
- `iv_diagnostics`: First-stage statistics
- `first_stage`: Detailed first-stage results

### 5. Wild Bootstrap with IV

The wild bootstrap has been adapted for IV estimation:
- Uses reduced-form residuals for bootstrapping
- Preserves IV structure in bootstrap samples
- Provides robust inference for 2SLS estimates

### 6. Formula Interface Enhancements

**Three-part syntax**:
```
"~ exogenous_controls | fixed_effects | endogenous ~ instruments"
```

**Examples**:
```python
# Just controls
"~ x1 + x2"

# Controls and FE
"~ x1 + x2 | industry + year"

# Full IV specification
"~ x1 + x2 | industry | D_treat ~ z1 + z2"

# IV with multiple endogenous variables
"~ x1 | FE | D_treat + D_treat:size ~ z1 + z2 + z1:size"
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### IV Regression Building

For each horizon h, the package:
1. Constructs the appropriate formula with endogenous variables
2. Passes to pyfixest for 2SLS estimation
3. Extracts coefficients, SEs, and diagnostics
4. Handles wild bootstrap for IV when requested

### Interaction Handling

The package:
1. Automatically adds main effects for interaction variables
2. Builds interaction terms in pyfixest syntax (var1:var2)
3. Extracts all interaction coefficients and inference
4. Reports results in organized columns

### Performance Optimizations

- Parallel processing across horizons (unchanged)
- Efficient formula construction
- Leverages pyfixest's C++ backend for IV
- Smart caching of repeated computations

## Example Use Cases

### 1. Endogenous Treatment Selection
```python
# Firms select into environmental regulations based on unobservables
# Use regulatory eligibility thresholds as instruments
formula = "~ size + industry_controls | state + year | D_treat ~ eligible + neighbor_treated"
```

### 2. Heterogeneous Policy Effects
```python
# How do minimum wage effects vary by firm size?
interactions = "~ log_employees + i.industry"
```

### 3. LATE with Heterogeneity
```python
# IV for treatment + explore heterogeneity in compliers
formula = "~ controls | FE | D_treat ~ instrument"
interactions = "~ firm_age + urban"
```

## Validation and Testing

The package includes comprehensive tests for:
- IV formula parsing
- Interaction term creation
- Combined IV + interaction specifications
- Diagnostic extraction
- Wild bootstrap with IV
- Backward compatibility

## Limitations and Considerations

1. **IV Requirements**: 
   - Need strong instruments (F > 10)
   - Exclusion restriction cannot be tested
   - LATE interpretation differs from ATE

2. **Interactions**:
   - Many interactions reduce power
   - Centering continuous moderators recommended
   - Multiple testing considerations

3. **Computational**:
   - IV + wild bootstrap can be slow
   - Many interactions increase computation time
   - Consider reducing bootstrap iterations for exploration

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- Support for multiple endogenous variables
- Anderson-Rubin confidence intervals
- Conditional LATE estimation
- Machine learning for optimal IV selection
- Visualization tools for heterogeneous effects

## Summary

The LP-DiD package now provides:
- ✅ Full IV support via pyfixest
- ✅ Treatment effect heterogeneity via interactions  
- ✅ Combined IV + heterogeneity analysis
- ✅ Comprehensive diagnostics and reporting
- ✅ Wild bootstrap for all specifications
- ✅ Formula-based interface for all features
- ✅ No plotting (as requested)
