# Changelog

All notable changes to the lpdid package will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.0] - 2024-01-XX

### Added - Initial Release

#### Core Features
- Local Projections Difference-in-Differences (LP-DiD) estimator
- Event study and pooled treatment effect estimation
- Support for absorbing and non-absorbing treatments
- Multiple control group options (never-treated, not-yet-treated, clean controls)
- Pre-mean differencing (PMD) baseline options
- Parallel processing support via joblib

#### Formula Interface
- R-style formula specification for controls and fixed effects
- Three-part formula syntax for instrumental variables
- Separate formulas for clustering variables
- Interaction specification for treatment effect heterogeneity

#### Instrumental Variables
- Built-in 2SLS support via pyfixest
- First-stage F-statistics and weak instrument diagnostics
- Kleibergen-Paap statistics when available
- First-stage coefficient reporting
- Compatible with wild bootstrap and all other features

#### Treatment Effect Heterogeneity
- Interaction terms between treatment and observables
- Support for continuous and categorical moderators
- Automatic inclusion of main effects
- Full inference on interaction coefficients
- Can be combined with IV for heterogeneous LATEs

#### Inference
- Analytical clustered standard errors
- Wild cluster bootstrap inference
- Multi-way clustering support
- Fallback wild bootstrap implementation
- Proper handling of weights in bootstrap

#### Output and Reporting
- Structured results object with DataFrames
- Comprehensive summary method
- IV diagnostics reporting
- First-stage results
- No plotting functionality (by design)

#### Additional Features
- Flexible weighting options
- Variance-weighted or equally-weighted ATE
- User-provided weights
- Outcome lags (levels and differences)
- Additional fixed effects absorption
- Backward compatibility with list-based interface

### Dependencies
- numpy >= 1.19.0
- pandas >= 1.1.0
- pyfixest >= 0.18.0
- scipy >= 1.5.0
- joblib >= 1.0.0
- matplotlib >= 3.3.0
- wildboottest >= 0.1.0 (optional)

### Known Limitations
- Binary treatment only (continuous treatment not yet supported)
- Single treatment variable (no multiple treatments)
- Requires balanced or nearly balanced panels for PMD

### Future Enhancements (Planned)
- GPU acceleration for large datasets
- Additional IV diagnostics (Anderson-Rubin)
- Support for continuous treatments
- Machine learning for covariate selection
- Integration with other causal inference packages

## Notes

This is the initial release of lpdid, providing a Python implementation of the LP-DiD estimator from Dube, Girardi, Jord√†, and Taylor (2023). The package aims to replicate and extend the functionality of the Stata lpdid package while leveraging Python's strengths for parallel processing and modern interfaces.
