# LP-DiD Python Package - Implementation Summary

## Overview

We have successfully created a comprehensive Python implementation of Local Projections Difference-in-Differences (LP-DiD) that not only replicates the Stata `lpdid` package functionality but extends it with modern features for causal inference.

## Package Features

### 1. Core LP-DiD Implementation ✓
- Event study estimation for each horizon
- Pooled pre/post treatment effects
- Support for both absorbing and non-absorbing treatments
- Multiple control group options (never-treated, not-yet-treated, clean controls)
- Pre-mean differencing (PMD) options

### 2. Formula Interface ✓
```python
# Simple controls and fixed effects
formula = "~ x1 + x2 | industry + year"

# With instrumental variables
formula = "~ x1 + x2 | industry | D_treat ~ z1 + z2"

# Clustering specification
cluster_formula = "~ state + year"
```

### 3. Instrumental Variables Support ✓
- Native 2SLS through pyfixest
- First-stage diagnostics (F-statistics, weak IV tests)
- Compatible with all other features
- Proper handling in wild bootstrap

### 4. Treatment Effect Heterogeneity ✓
```python
# Explore how effects vary
interactions = "~ size + i.industry"
```
- Automatic inclusion of main effects
- Support for continuous and categorical moderators
- Full inference on interaction terms
- Can be combined with IV for heterogeneous LATEs

### 5. Wild Bootstrap Inference ✓
- Cluster-robust wild bootstrap
- Adapted for IV estimation
- Fallback implementation included
- Compatible with weights and multi-way clustering

### 6. Advanced Features ✓
- **Parallel processing**: `n_jobs` parameter for speed
- **Multi-way clustering**: Multiple clustering variables
- **Flexible weighting**: User weights + reweighting options
- **Comprehensive diagnostics**: All relevant test statistics
- **No plotting**: As requested, focus on numerical results

```

## Key Implementation Details

### Formula Parsing
- Three-part formula: `"~ controls | FE | endog ~ instruments"`
- Separate parsing for interactions and clusters
- Backward compatibility with list-based interface

### Regression Building
- Dynamic formula construction for pyfixest
- Proper handling of interaction terms
- IV specification passed directly to pyfixest

### Results Structure
```python
results = lpdid.fit()
results.event_study      # Main estimates with interactions
results.pooled          # Pre/post pooled effects
results.iv_diagnostics  # First-stage F-stats, etc.
results.first_stage     # Detailed first-stage results
results.summary()       # Comprehensive printed summary
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic DiD
```python
lpdid = LPDiD(
    data=df,
    depvar='y',
    unit='unit',
    time='time',
    treat='treat',
    pre_window=5,
    post_window=10,
    formula="~ x1 + x2 | industry"
)
```

### IV for Endogenous Treatment
```python
lpdid_iv = LPDiD(
    data=df,
    depvar='y',
    unit='unit',
    time='time',
    treat='treat',
    pre_window=5,
    post_window=10,
    formula="~ x1 | FE | D_treat ~ eligibility + spillover",
    wildbootstrap=999
)
```

### Heterogeneous Effects
```python
lpdid_het = LPDiD(
    data=df,
    depvar='y',
    unit='unit',
    time='time',
    treat='treat',
    pre_window=5,
    post_window=10,
    formula="~ x1 | FE",
    interactions="~ size + urban"
)
```

### Full Specification
```python
lpdid_full = LPDiD(
    data=df,
    depvar='y',
    unit='unit',
    time='time',
    treat='treat',
    pre_window=5,
    post_window=10,
    formula="~ x1 + x2 | industry + year | D_treat ~ z1 + z2",
    interactions="~ size + i.region",
    cluster_formula="~ state + year",
    weights='population',
    rw=True,
    pmd='max',
    wildbootstrap=999,
    n_jobs=-1
)
```

## Testing

The package includes comprehensive tests for:
- Basic estimation
- Formula parsing (including IV)
- Wild bootstrap
- Multi-way clustering
- Interaction terms
- IV diagnostics
- Combined specifications
- Backward compatibility

## Performance Considerations

1. **Parallel Processing**: Significant speedup for many horizons
2. **IV Overhead**: 2SLS adds computation time
3. **Wild Bootstrap**: Can be intensive; use fewer iterations initially
4. **Interactions**: Many interactions increase computation

## Dependencies

### Required
- numpy, pandas, pyfixest, scipy, joblib, matplotlib

### Optional
- wildboottest (for optimized wild bootstrap)

## Installation

```bash
# From source
git clone <repo>
cd lpdid
pip install -e .

# From PyPI (when published)
pip install lpdid

# With all features
pip install lpdid[all]
```

## Next Steps for Users

1. **Start Simple**: Basic DiD without IV or interactions
2. **Check Diagnostics**: For IV, always check first-stage F
3. **Explore Heterogeneity**: Add interactions gradually
4. **Bootstrap Carefully**: Start with 99-499 iterations
5. **Use Parallelization**: Set `n_jobs=-1` for speed

## Package Status

✅ **Complete and Ready for Use**

The package provides a modern, efficient, and comprehensive implementation of LP-DiD with advanced causal inference features. It maintains compatibility with the Stata version while leveraging Python's strengths for parallel processing, modern interfaces, and extensibility.
